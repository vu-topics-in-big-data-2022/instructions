# What is AWS CLI?
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open source tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. With minimal configuration, the AWS CLI enables you to start running commands that implement functionality equivalent to that provided by the browser-based AWS Management Console from the command prompt in your terminal program:

- **Linux shells** – Use common shell programs such as [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/), and [tcsh](https://www.tcsh.org/) to run commands in Linux or macOS.

- **Windows command line** – On Windows, run commands at the Windows command prompt or in PowerShell.

- **Remotely** – Run commands on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances through a remote terminal program such as PuTTY or SSH, or with AWS Systems Manager.
